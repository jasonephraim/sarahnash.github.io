    <p>It has taken me 11 years, 3 jobs, much wasted money, and infinite tears to find my passion.  I am right on time!</p>
    <p>Over the next 26 weeks, I am dedicating my time to developing this passion into what I hope will become a life long practice.</p>
    <p>This picture is the front desk of my first tech company.  It was MY desk and my very first job in tech: receptionist/data clerk.  They needed someone with a high enough EQ to sit at the front desk, and a high enough IQ to “audit various critical datasets for integrity.”  Through eagerness and determination I worked up from that desk.  During my 5 year tenure, I:</p>

    <ul>
	<li>owned data support and user migrations for a $400 million business entity</li>
	<li>created team performance reports for the CIO</li>
	<li>recruited top talent at the most prestigious universities in the country</li>
	<li>had A LOT of fun and made life long friends</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Growing up in the East End of Houston, no one ever mentioned computer science to me.  My mother graduated college with a teaching degree she didn’t use.  My father worked 40 years as a machinist.  They did everything they could to provide for my education.  It was assumed I’d go to college and when I did, people said “do something you like!”  I majored in Anthropology.</p>
    <p>A Latina anthropologist from inner city Houston is not the expected profile of a Data Analyst at a career destination company.  Unfortunately, I am the one who started to believe this.  Imposter syndrome clouded all of my accomplishments in a shroud of luck and allowance.  I lost momentum, blamed others, and bailed.</p>
    <p>I went into what I thought would be a more natural fit for my “profile”: the classroom of an inner city middle school.  It was the most gut-wrenching and rewarding year of my life.  To try and make sense of the situation of so many of our kids is impossible.  Their resilience is inspiring.  Mine, was fledgling, and I had to painfully admit that I am not suited for the classroom.  What then?</p>
    <p>The Universe put me in my place: I’m now in the IT department of my school district.  There are no more excuses, and I will never be satisfied.  I have the ability, the means, and the social network to succeed.  This Fall, I choose to step into my passion through the <a href="https://www.digitalcrafts.com/full-stack-flex.html">DigitalCrafts</a> full stack developer program.</p>
    <p>This website is my first endeavor.  Stay tuned!</p>
